		<title>Community Market Village Rules!</title>
		<text>
 - Must be Level 20 to claim spot this should help those day 1 peeps claiming good spots never to return.
 - NO Heat Generating work stations camp fire and a Workbench are fine.
 - NO Skyscrapers no need for silly mega bases.
 - You may only have 1 of the Market spots
 - NO TREE FARMS a couple for decoration is fine.
 - NO SNOW TREES Ragnar has an issue when snow trees are anywhere but Snow Biome ðŸ˜†
 - Digging digging down is fine, just stay within your LCB, no digging under the roads.
 - Vending Machines no limit on your Market spot.
 - Getting started once you reach 20, pick a spot, and call an admin, we will remove the current LCB and you must place yours in the exact spot.
 - If having your own Market is not for you, we have a few spots available at the main building, you can have 1 or the other, not both.
