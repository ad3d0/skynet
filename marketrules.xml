		<title>Community Market Village Rules!</title>
		<text>
 - Main purpose for market village is to provide people with opportunity to build their own custom stores. You can have a personal store, you can team up with other people and build a group store.
 - Must be Level 20 to claim spot.
 - All available to claim spots will be market by red exclamation mark in the middle.
 - Once you reach lvl 20, pick a spot, and call an admin, we will remove the current LCB and you must place yours in the exact spot.
 - NO Heat Generating work stations. You can have 1 camp fire or any cooking station and as many workbenches as you need.
 - NO Skyscrapers no need for silly mega bases. Max allowed height is 15-20 blocks above road level.
 - You are allowed to claim only 1 of the Market spots.
 - NO TREE FARMS, few trees just for decoration are allowed. NO SNOW TREES are allowed.
 - Digging down is fine, just stay within your LCB, no digging under the roads.
 - There are no limit on vending machines you can have on your claim at market.
 - If having your own Market is not for you, we have a few spots available at the main building, you can have 1 or the other, not both.
