Good Day Skyfam!

As you guys know Stable release of 7 days to die should hit Jully 25th! 

We will wipe all 3 servers, but because no-one wants to wipe on a random Thursday, we shall do it Saturday, that is generally most folks off time...and it gives us a bit more time to work out our final changes. 

We will turn on SKYNET PURGE (pvp) Friday, July 26, 2024 1PM CST for those who have a need to blood can get their fill before starting over!

Thank you all for playing with us!!!
