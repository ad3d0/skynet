		<title>Community Market Village Rules!</title>
		<text>
- Main purpose for market village is to provide people with opportunity to build their own custom stores. You can have a personal store, you can team up with other people and build a group store.

			
- Must be Level 20 to claim a single spot this should help those day 1 peeps claiming good spots never to return.
- Getting started once you reach level 20, pick a spot, and call an admin, we will remove the current LCB and you must place yours in the exact spot.
- You may place as manyVending Machines as you wish on your plot.
			
- NO Skyscrapers, no need for silly mega bases. Max Height allowed is 15-20 blocks above road level.
- NO Heat Generating work stations (including Water collectors) a single camp fire and a Workbench are fine, this is not meant to be your personal **SAFE** home.
- NO Farming other than strictly decoration purposes.	
- NO SNOW TREES Ragnar has an issue when snow trees are anywhere but Snow Biome XD
- Digging down a bit is fine, just stay within your LCB, no digging under the roads.

- If we find you placed your LCB in the wrong position, or ignore the very few rules we have set, your stuff could get removed without warning.
