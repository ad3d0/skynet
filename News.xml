		<title>First batch of QOL updates and more!</title>
		<text>Today changes:
- Expanded player inventory from 45 to 60 slots.
- Added 45 different dye colors. All dyes can be found in loot or bought from traders, just like vanilla dyes.
- Supporter buffs are back

IMPORTANT information about City Resets:
- Starting today City resets will happen live, that means server will not run a restart for those.
- Server will give a 30 minutes countdown in chat before city resets.
- If you happen to be running a quest when city rest happens it might reset it for you, same way as if you log out during active quest.
- City resets will reset all marked regions to the day 1 state, it should not wipe your vehicles or remove your player death bag.

		<title>We are going stable!</title>
		<text>
Good Day Skyfam!

As you guys know Stable release of 7 days to die should hit Jully 25th! 

We will wipe all 3 servers, but because no-one wants to wipe on a random Thursday, we shall do it Saturday, that is generally most folks off time...and it gives us a bit more time to work out our final changes. 

We will turn on SKYNET PURGE (pvp) Friday, July 26, 2024 1PM CST for those who have a need to blood can get their fill before starting over!

Thank you all for playing with us!!!
