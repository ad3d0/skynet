		<title>First batch of QOL updates and more!</title>
		<text>Today changes:
- Expanded player inventory from 45 to 60 slots.
- Added 45 different dye colors. All dyes can be found in loot or bought from traders, just like vanilla dyes.
- Supporter buffs are back

IMPORTANT information about City Resets:
- Starting today City resets will happen live, that means server will not run a restart for those.
- Server will give a 30 minutes countdown in chat before city resets.
- If you happen to be running a quest when city rest happens it might reset it for you, same way as if you log out during active quest.
- City resets will reset all marked regions to the day 1 state, it should not wipe your vehicles or remove your player death bag.
